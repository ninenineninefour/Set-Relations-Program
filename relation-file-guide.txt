8		<- Number of elements in the relation. The matrix is square, so only one number is required.
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <- Start of the matrix. Each one or zero should be seperated by a space or a linebreak.
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0    This can be arranged in any fashion (even on the same line), but doing it by row
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0    is more human-readable. Any tokens other than "1" or "0" are discarded.
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

THINGS THAT CAUSE ERRORS:
 - Something other than the dimensions as the first token of the file
 - Having fewer than n^2 ones or zeroes (n = # of elements)
 - Extremely large number of elements. In theory, it should handle up to 2^32-1 (maximum signed 32-bit
   int), but I imagine you'd run into errors long before then. Also, it would probably take a very,
   very long time.

THINGS THAT CAUSE ODD EFFECTS BUT STILL WORK:
 - Having more than n^2 ones or zeroes
   > The program will ignore any ones or zeroes beyond the (n^2)th element.
 - Having 0 elements
   > I mean, sure, I guess that's valid, but why bother at that point?
